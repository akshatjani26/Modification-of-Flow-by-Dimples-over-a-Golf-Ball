# Modification-of-Flow-by-Dimples-over-a-Golf-Ball
## M.Tech Course Project: Sports Aerodynamics (AE 643)

– Conducted an extensive literature review to evaluate the impact of dimples on flow physics, projectile range & aerodynamic parameters. Explored 4 different dimple types and configurations for optimal ball performance
– Compared pressure and velocity contours, streamlines, pathlines, etc of a golf ball with a smooth sphere through CFD analysis using Ansys Fluent, with CAD geometry created in SolidWorks. Illustrated a 2x increase in range
